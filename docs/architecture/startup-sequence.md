# Startup Sequence

Documents the full initialization flow from app launch to interactive state, covering both the Rust backend and Vue frontend.

Timings are approximate and vary by machine, data size, and network conditions.

## Backend Sequence (Rust)

All backend initialization happens synchronously inside `tauri::Builder::setup()` in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`.

### Step 1: Settings (`src-tauri/src/settings.rs`)
- `SettingsManager::new()` loads `settings.json` from the app data directory
- This is **blocking** — everything else depends on settings

### Step 2: Version Check & Database Nuke
- Compares `last_app_version` in settings against current app version
- If changed: deletes the database file + WAL/SHM sidecars (prototype-phase behavior)
- Persists current version to settings

### Step 3: Database (`src-tauri/src/db/mod.rs`)
- `db::init_pool()` creates the SQLite connection pool
- Runs the unified v1 migration schema
- Sets WAL mode, foreign keys, busy timeout pragmas
- **Blocking** — coordinator needs the pool

### Step 4: Coordinator (`src-tauri/src/coordinator.rs`)
- `DataIngestCoordinator::new()` creates the coordinator with:
  - DB pool, settings, app handle, game data state (empty at this point)
- Seeds `GameStateManager` with persisted character/server names from settings
- Player and chat watchers are `None` — not started yet
- **Blocking** — must be registered as managed state

### Step 5: State Registration
- `settings_manager`, `db_pool`, and `coordinator` registered as Tauri managed state
- Frontend commands can now be invoked

### Step 6: Game Data Load (Background)
- `tauri::async_runtime::spawn()` kicks off `init_game_data()`
- **Non-blocking** — setup() returns immediately after spawning
- On success: emits `game-data-ready` event, then persists CDN data to database
- On failure: emits `game-data-error` event
- Takes ~2 seconds (10K+ items, 23K+ effects, etc.)

## Frontend Sequence (Vue)

### Phase: `splash`
- Initial state when `App.vue` mounts
- Shows `StartupSplash` component
- `startup.initialize()` is called in `onMounted`

### Phase Decision (`src/stores/startupStore.ts`)
After loading settings and server list:

| Condition | Next Phase |
|-----------|------------|
| `!setupCompleted \|\| !gameDataPath` | `setup-path` (first-time wizard) |
| `autoLoadLastCharacter && activeCharacterName` | `loading` |
| Otherwise | `select-character` |

### Phase: `loading` (`runStartupTasks`)

Shows `StartupProgress` with a 4-task checklist. Each task must complete before the next begins. All tasks are orchestrated by `startupStore.runStartupTasks()`.

**Task 1: Loading game data**
- Waits for `gameDataStore.status` to become `"ready"` (watches the reactive ref)
- The Rust backend is already loading CDN data in a background task spawned during setup()
- If status becomes `"error"`, startup halts and shows an error message
- This is the only **fatal** task — all others are resilient

**Task 2: Catching up on logs**
- Registers Tauri event listeners (`skill-update`, `survey-event`, `survey-session-ended`, `player-event`)
- Starts Player.log tailing if `autoTailPlayerLog` enabled
- Starts chat log tailing if `autoTailChat` enabled
- Runs one synchronous `poll_watchers` call that **blocks until all historical log content is parsed**
  - This resolves the active character from log history
  - Seeds game state tables from log events (inventory, skills, equipment, etc.)
  - On resume from saved position, the watcher is seeded with the last-known character name from `log_file_positions`
- Starts periodic polling (1500ms interval) for live updates
- Reloads settings from backend (catch-up may have updated active character/server)
- Non-fatal — partial failures log warnings but don't block startup

**Task 3: Loading character data**
- Calls `characterStore.initForActiveCharacter()` which:
  - Auto-imports the latest character report from the Reports folder
  - Seeds game state from the report (skills, favor, recipes, currencies)
  - Loads character list and snapshots, auto-selects most recent
  - Auto-imports latest inventory report (seeds storage)
  - Background-imports reports for all other characters on the server (for aggregate views)
- Now uses the **correct** active character resolved by the catch-up in Task 2
- Non-fatal — if no reports exist, continues with empty character data

**Task 4: Preparing game state**
- Calls `gameStateStore.loadAll()` — loads all 11 game state domains from the database:
  - skills, attributes, active_skills, world, inventory, recipes, equipment, favor, currencies, effects, storage
- Loads storage vault CDN metadata (`gameStateStore.loadStorageVaults()`)
- Loads market values (`marketStore.loadAll()`)
- This pulls in everything seeded by Tasks 2 and 3 plus any data already in the DB from prior sessions

### Phase: `ready`
- All startup tasks completed successfully
- `gameState.startupComplete` set to `true` — enables live `character-login` handling
- `"App is interactive"` logged to backend
- Main UI renders (MenuBar, view panels, ToastContainer)
- Game data, game state, and character data are all available
- Log watchers are already running and fully caught up

### Character Identity During Startup

During the startup catch-up, `character-login` events are emitted by the backend as it replays historical log content. The `gameStateStore` listener updates `settingsStore.settings.activeCharacterName` reactively but **skips** the heavy reload work (resetting session state, calling `loadAll()`, calling `initForActiveCharacter()`) until `startupComplete` is true. This prevents redundant reloads during catch-up — the startup sequence handles loading character and game state explicitly after catch-up finishes.

Once the app is `ready`, `character-login` events from live log tailing trigger the full reload flow: reset session skills, clear live inventory, reload all game state, and reinitialize character data.

### Ongoing: Post-Ready Background Work
After the app is interactive:
- **Report polling**: If `autoWatchReports` is enabled, periodically checks for new character/inventory reports.
- **CDN persistence**: CDN data is written to the database after game-data-ready (~2s after data load).

## Error Handling

| Failure | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| Game data load fails | Startup halts on Task 1. Error shown in StartupProgress with red X and message. |
| Log watcher start fails | Task 2 completes with warning. App continues but no live data flows. |
| Character report import fails | Task 3 completes with "Partial" note. App continues with empty character data. |
| Game state load fails | Task 4 shows error. App continues — some features may show empty state. |
