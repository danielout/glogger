# Economics — Stall Tracker

## Overview

Player-stall analytics built from the in-game **PlayerShopLog** book. Every time
the user opens their shop log in-game, Glogger captures the book content via the
Player.log `ProcessBook` event, parses each log line into a structured event,
and persists it to SQLite. The Stall Tracker screen then presents that history
as sales, revenue, and estimated current inventory.

The feature is **fully scoped to the active character**. A single account may
run multiple alts, each with their own stall; every query, aggregation, import,
export, and filter dropdown filters on `owner = <active character>` so
characters don't cross-contaminate.

Shop log data also supports **Import** (load an exported book file) and
**Export** (write one book-format file per date) so users can backfill historic
data from CSVs or back up a character before the in-game log scrolls old
entries out of range.

The Stall Tracker has three visible tabs plus a fourth view behind a modal:

| View | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Sales | Paginated list of every `bought` event with filters, sorting, stats header, per-row ignore toggle |
| Revenue | Excel-style pivot of revenue with items as rows and daily/weekly/monthly periods as columns |
| Inventory | Estimated current shop stock reconstructed from the event log with per-tier pricing |
| Shop Log (modal) | Full event log across all action types — a maintenance view for finding/ignoring specific events |

## Architecture

### Files

**Backend (Rust):**
- `src-tauri/src/shop_log_parser.rs` — regex parser: splits book content into entries, extracts fields per action type, assigns stable indices, detects owner.
- `src-tauri/src/stall_year_resolver.rs` — resolves the game's year-less `"Mon Apr 13 14:29"` timestamps into ISO 8601 by walking forward through the entries and handling year-boundary crossings.
- `src-tauri/src/stall_aggregations.rs` — pure aggregation logic for Revenue pivot and Inventory tier-stack reconstruction. No DB access.
- `src-tauri/src/db/stall_tracker_commands.rs` — Tauri commands, filter shape, `StallOpsLock`, insert helper, import/export.
- `src-tauri/src/db/migrations.rs` — `stall_events` table creation.
- `src-tauri/src/coordinator.rs` — intercepts `PlayerEvent::BookOpened { book_type: "PlayerShopLog", … }` and persists the parsed events.

**Frontend (Vue/TS):**
- `src/types/stallTracker.ts` — `StallEvent`, `StallStats` TypeScript types.
- `src/stores/stallTrackerStore.ts` — shared state (`stats`, `filterOptions`, `dataVersion`, `currentOwner`), listens for coordinator events.
- `src/components/StallTracker/StallTrackerView.vue` — parent view with `TabBar`, action-row buttons, Shop Log modal.
- `src/components/StallTracker/StallSalesTab.vue` — paginated sales table + stats header.
- `src/components/StallTracker/StallRevenueTab.vue` — pivot table (Daily / Weekly / Monthly).
- `src/components/StallTracker/StallInventoryTab.vue` — In Stock + Recently Sold Out tables.
- `src/components/StallTracker/StallShopLogTab.vue` — full event log (rendered inside a teleported modal).

The Player.log watcher is the only source in the live path. **Chat.log is not
involved** — unlike Surveying, stall events never need cross-log correction.

## Shop Log Parsing

A `PlayerShopLog` book's content is a `\n\n`-separated list of entries, each
prefixed with a `Day Mon DD HH:MM - ` timestamp. Six action types are
recognized; a seventh bucket (`unknown`) captures anything that doesn't match so
nothing is silently dropped.

| Action | Example line | Fields parsed |
|---|---|---|
| `bought` | `MrBonq bought Quality Reins at a cost of 4500 per 1 = 4500` | player (buyer), item, quantity, price_unit, price_total |
| `added` | `Deradon added Barley Seeds x36 to shop` | player (owner), item, quantity |
| `removed` | `Deradon removed Decent Horseshoes from shop` | player (owner), item, quantity |
| `configured` | `Deradon configured Barley Seedsx36 to cost 3000 per 2.` | player (owner), item, quantity, price_unit |
| `visible` | `Deradon made Nice Saddle visible in shop at a cost of 4000 per 1` | player (owner), item, quantity, price_unit |
| `collected` | `Deradon collected 30500 Councils from customer purchases` | player (owner), price_total |

### Entry Index Stability

Shop log content arrives **newest-first** from the game. If we indexed entries
in content order, the newest entry would be `0`, and when the user re-opened
the same book with new entries prepended, every existing entry would shift to a
higher index — breaking the deduplication key.

The parser reverses the raw entries before indexing so the **oldest entry always
gets index `0`**. New entries appended at the top later receive higher indices,
keeping existing entries' indices stable across re-opens. The deduplication key
is `(event_timestamp, raw_message, entry_index)`; the index is the tiebreaker
for same-minute duplicates like two buyers of the same item at the same price.

### Year Resolution

The game's in-game book format omits the year — `Mon Apr 13 14:29`. The Stall
Tracker needs a real ISO timestamp (`event_at`) for date-range filtering, for
revenue pivot grouping, and for the export round-trip. Resolution strategy:

- **Live tailing** — `base_year_for_live()` starts from `now.year()` and walks
  back one year if the oldest entry's `(month, day)` is in the future relative
  to now, meaning the book contains entries from the previous calendar year.
- **Import** — `year_from_filename()` extracts a 4-digit year between 2000 and
  2099 from the filename (e.g., `Deradon-shop-log-2026-04-13.txt`), falling
  back to `Local::now().year()` if no match.
- **Backfill** — infers year from `created_at`. Events can never be in the
  future at insert time, so if the parsed `(month, day)` is later than
  `created_at`'s month/day, the event is from the previous year. Used when a
  schema change adds `event_at` to rows that pre-date the column.

`resolve_timestamps_oldest_first()` then walks the entries forward. Any
backward month jump (e.g., Dec → Jan) increments the year, so books that span a
year boundary resolve correctly.

### Owner Assignment

Every row is stamped with an `owner` at insert time so reads can scope by
character. The source of that owner depends on the ingest path:

- **Live tailing** — the owner is **always the active character** from
  `settingsStore.activeCharacterName`. The game only lets a player open their
  own `PlayerShopLog` book, so the active character is the book owner by
  definition. The coordinator does not parse the owner out of the book body.
- **Import** — the parser advisory-detects an owner by scanning for the first
  **owner action** (`added`, `removed`, `configured`, `visible`, `collected`)
  — actions only a stall owner can perform. This hint lets the import
  command distinguish three cases:
  1. **Book owner matches active character** — normal import, stamp with the
     parsed owner.
  2. **Book owner is a different character** — e.g., a file sent by a
     guildmate, or an alt's export. Stamp with the parsed owner and return
     it in `ImportResult.effective_owner` so the UI can surface
     *"Imported 134 for Alvida. Switch character to view them."*
  3. **Book has no owner actions at all** — bought-only historical files
     (CSV-derived books, old exports). Fall back to the caller-supplied
     `current_owner` and set `ImportResult.owner_claimed = true`. The UI
     surfaces *"claimed for Deradon — book(s) did not identify an owner."*

The parser exposes the owner hint as `ShopLog.owner: Option<String>`. It is
**advisory only** — the coordinator ignores it in the live path, and the
import command treats it as "owner if known, else fall back." Do not treat
`ShopLog.owner` as a source of truth anywhere else.

## Database Schema

### `stall_events`

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | INTEGER PK | auto-increment |
| event_timestamp | TEXT | Raw game format `"Mon Apr 13 14:29"`. Preserved for round-trip export. |
| event_at | TEXT | Real ISO 8601 `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"`. All time-range queries use this column. |
| log_timestamp | TEXT | Timestamp when the book was opened. `"imported"` / `"seeded"` for synthetic rows. |
| log_title | TEXT | `"Today's Shop Logs"`, `"Yesterday's Shop Logs"`, `"Imported"`, `"Seeded"`. |
| action | TEXT | One of the six action types plus `"unknown"`. |
| player | TEXT | Buyer for `bought`, owner for everything else. |
| owner | TEXT | The character that owns this row's data. Every read/mutation scopes on this. |
| item | TEXT | Nullable (`collected` has no item). |
| quantity | INTEGER | Defaults to 1. |
| price_unit | REAL | Price per unit (possibly fractional for `per N > 1` entries). |
| price_total | INTEGER | Total price for `bought` and `collected`. |
| raw_message | TEXT | Exact in-game phrasing, used for export round-trip. |
| entry_index | INTEGER | Position within the book (oldest = 0). Stable across re-opens. |
| ignored | INTEGER | 0/1 soft-mute flag. Excluded from all aggregations. |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | SQLite `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` at insert time. |

**Unique constraint:** `(event_timestamp, raw_message, entry_index)` — the
deduplication key used by `INSERT OR IGNORE`. The `entry_index` component is
essential: two identical events within the same minute (e.g., two buyers of
the same item at the same price) would otherwise collapse into a single row.

**Indices:** `action`, `created_at DESC`, `event_timestamp`, `event_at DESC`,
`(action, event_at DESC)`, `player`, `item`.

## Tauri Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `get_stall_events(params)` | Paginated list of events with filters, sort, limit/offset. Returns `{ rows, total_count }`. Empty when `owner` missing. |
| `get_stall_stats(filters)` | Aggregate stats (total sales, revenue, unique buyers/items) for the Sales header. Always scoped to `bought` + non-ignored. |
| `get_stall_revenue(params)` | Daily/weekly/monthly pivot. Returns pre-computed `periods`, `items`, `cells`, row/col totals, grand total. |
| `get_stall_inventory(params)` | Inventory tier-stack snapshot with per-item quantity, price tiers, period sales, and last sold. |
| `get_stall_filter_options(owner)` | Distinct buyers, players, items, dates, actions for filter dropdowns. |
| `toggle_stall_event_ignored(id, ignored)` | Soft-mute or unmute a single event. |
| `clear_stall_events(owner)` | Delete every row for a specific character. Requires `owner`. Holds `StallOpsLock`. |
| `import_shop_log_file(path, current_owner)` | Read a `.txt` file, parse, insert. Returns counts + effective owner + `owner_claimed` flag. |
| `export_shop_log_files(directory, owner)` | Write one file per (owner, date) in exact book format for round-trip. Requires `owner`. |
| `seed_stall_events_dev(count, owner)` | Dev-only bulk insert for benchmarking at 10k/100k scale. |

### Filter shape

```rust
pub struct StallEventsFilters {
    pub owner: Option<String>,       // ALWAYS passed by the frontend
    pub action: Option<String>,      // force-override available via force_action param
    pub player: Option<String>,
    pub item: Option<String>,
    pub date_from: Option<String>,   // "YYYY-MM-DD"
    pub date_to: Option<String>,     // "YYYY-MM-DD"
    pub include_ignored: Option<bool>,
}
```

The backend `build_filter_where()` helper turns this into a WHERE clause + bound
parameter list. Queries with a missing/empty `owner` return empty results
instead of leaking cross-character data.

## Frontend Events

| Event | Payload | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `stall-events-updated` | `usize` (new row count) | Emitted by the coordinator after every successful live-ingest batch. The store debounces 500ms and bumps `dataVersion`. |

## Concurrency & Race Protection

`StallOpsLock(Mutex<()>)` is registered as Tauri managed state. Both
`insert_stall_events()` (coordinator's live-ingest path) and
`clear_stall_events()` acquire it around their DB mutation, so a Clear can
never interleave with a concurrent `PlayerShopLog` insert and leave partial or
orphaned rows behind. Critical sections are intentionally small (one batch /
one DELETE); contention is invisible in practice.

## Character Scoping

Every query, aggregation, mutation, import, export, and filter-option lookup
is scoped to `owner = <active character>`. This is enforced at three layers:

1. **Backend guard** — read commands return empty results when `owner` is
   missing/empty. Mutation commands (`clear`, `export`, `seed`) return a
   `"requires an owner"` error.
2. **Frontend contract** — the store exposes `currentOwner` as a reactive
   computed over `settingsStore.settings.activeCharacterName`. Every tab
   threads it through `buildParams()` / `reload()`. Empty strings are
   normalized to `null`.
3. **UI gating** — Clear and Export buttons are hidden unless
   `hasData && store.currentOwner`. Belt-and-suspenders.

When the active character changes, `stallTrackerStore` watches `currentOwner`
and bumps `dataVersion`, which triggers every tab's `watch(() => store.dataVersion)`
to refetch. Each tab also watches `currentOwner` directly to reset its local
filter state, so a buyer name from character A doesn't silently carry over to
character B.

## Time Handling

Stall Tracker follows the app-wide time standards defined in
[time.md](../../../architecture/time.md).

- **`event_timestamp`** stores the raw game format (`"Mon Apr 13 14:29"`) and
  is only used by Export to reconstruct the book body verbatim.
- **`event_at`** is the real ISO 8601 datetime derived by `stall_year_resolver`.
  All date-range filters, Revenue pivot grouping, and Inventory window logic
  use this column.
- **Display format** — the Sales and Shop Log tabs display the raw
  `event_timestamp` (the game's own format) since users are already trained on
  it and no conversion adds clarity. The Inventory tab's "Last Sold" / "Last
  Activity" columns slice the first 10 chars of `event_at` and render them as
  `"Apr 13"`.
- **Revenue year suffix** — when `aggregate_revenue` detects that the dataset
  spans multiple calendar years, daily and weekly period labels get a year
  suffix (`"Apr 13 2026"`) so same-label collisions can't happen. Single-year
  datasets keep the concise no-year format. Detection is a single-pass HashSet
  over `event_at` dates.

## Known Issues & Improvement Plans

- Inventory reconstruction is only as accurate as the shop log history — if the
  log was truncated before an item was added, its baseline is lost and the tab
  can report negative-then-clamped quantities until a fresh `added` event
  resets the tier stack. This is acknowledged via an italic note below the
  Inventory stats header.
- The parser treats entries that don't match any action regex as `"unknown"`
  (e.g., the hire-duration messages). These are excluded from the list views
  and from every aggregation. A future improvement could parse the hire
  messages to surface stall maintenance costs.
