# Character Screen

## Overview

The character screen is a 9-tab hub for all character-specific data: skill progression, character report stats, NPC relationships, quest tracking, death tracking, gourmand progress, Statehelm reputation tracking, build planning, and account-wide analytics. Data comes from a mix of live session tracking, persisted game state, character report imports, and CDN enrichment.

## Architecture

### Files

**Frontend (Vue/TS):**
- `src/components/Character/CharacterView.vue` — 9-tab container
- `src/components/Character/SkillsScreen.vue` — skills tab (two-panel + tracked skills)
- `src/components/Character/NpcsScreen.vue` — NPCs tab (two-panel favor/services)
- `src/components/Character/QuestsScreen.vue` — quests tab (two-panel with eligibility)
- Stats, Gourmand, Build Planner, and Account tabs are rendered inline in CharacterView

**Stores:**
- `characterStore` — character report import, snapshot management, recipe/NPC data
- `gameStateStore` — persisted skills, favor, active skills, session tracking
- `gameDataStore` — CDN enrichment (skill details, NPC data, quest data)

## Data Sources

| Data | Source | Persistence |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Skill levels & XP | `game_state_skills` (DB) + session tracking (memory) | DB + session |
| Active combat skills | `game_state_active_skills` (DB) | DB |
| NPC favor | `game_state_favor` (DB) | DB |
| Gift log | `game_state_gift_log` (DB) | DB |
| Character report data | `character_snapshots` (DB) | DB |
| Skill/NPC/Quest details | CDN via `gameDataStore` | CDN cache |
| Tracked skills | DB (per-character) | DB |
| Session XP rates | In-memory (gameStateStore) | Session only |

## Key Design Decisions

- **Three data source merge for skills** — persisted levels from login dumps, live session XP tracking, and CDN enrichment are merged into a unified view.
- **Two-panel layout** — Skills, NPCs, and Quests all use a list-on-left, detail-on-right pattern for efficient browsing.
- **Tracked skills** — players pin important skills for quick access as rich cards, avoiding an overwhelming grid of all skills.
- **Personalized quest eligibility** — quest requirements are checked against the player's actual skill levels and favor, showing which quests they can currently accept.
